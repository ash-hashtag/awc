A Simple Alien Fan Controller for *only* DELL G15 5515 (My Personal Laptop)

I just wanted to explore ZIG, so thought it would be a good idea


depends on acpi_call

needs sudo privileges to make /proc/acpi/call (should try to avoid)
but since I did this for my own personal use, I don't care much

The config file is *main.zig* itself, yeah just write in zig format, no need for other config files and compile it
